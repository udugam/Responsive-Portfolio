                <p>
                    I've often been called a man of many trades. Starting with my education in Mechanical Engineering
                    from the University of Toronto, I always found a special interest in programming and excelled in everything related.
                    As obvious as it seems now, at that time I never thought to take a step back and evaluate what I was good at. Instead I continued
                    along the mechanical engineering path that I had laid out for myself because that was how it was "supposed" to happen.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Following graduation, I continued to tinker with Arudino programming and robotics as I looked for employment 
                    in a completely unrelated field (a recurring theme in my road to becoming a developer). Along the way I picked up another degree
                    in education becoming an Ontario Certified Teacher (OCT), gained specialized loss prevention knowledge while working for an insurance company,
                    and became a carpenter/entrepreneur building kitchen cabinetry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to think that the unrelated experience and knowledge I've gained gives me a unique perspective on software development and how it fits into different 
                    industries from a user's and business owner's perspective...it's the only way I cope with the years I've missed out on programming!
